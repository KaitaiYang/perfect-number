# Perfect Number
An integer is said to be a perfect number if the sum of its divisors, including 1 (but not the number itself), is equal to the number. For example, 6 is a perfect number, because 6 = 1 + 2 + 3. Write a C++ program to print all the perfect numbers between 2 to n (<=10000), and list the divisors of each perfect number.

## Example: 
```
Please input an integer n: 1000
Perfect number(s) between 2 and 1000:
6 = 1 + 2 + 3
28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14
496 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 31 + 62 + 124 + 248
```

## Bonus:
Write a function **IsPerfect(int number)** to determine whether the parameter number is a perfect number. The function returns 1 if the number is a perfect number, and 0 otherwise. Use this function to complete your program.
